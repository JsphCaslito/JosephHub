						In your everyday life, have you ever seen a parent carrying five children and thinking? Why do they need that many children? Now have you ever rode the MRT or any train transit and ask yourself, why are there so many people riding this train, why is it so cramped in here? Well, me too, and I think that one reason for this is because of overpopulation. Over 69 years ago the world’s population was only 2.5 billion people and now, our current world population is 7.8 billion. It only took 69 years our world’s human population has tripled in quantity and this may cause us some problems. Us humans live in a home or a shelter to be saved from the dangers of the outside. Now to make these homes and shelters we need space so us humans have started to cut down forests to get enough materials and to make space for these homes. Now because there are more homes it would mean more people to come over and live and because there are a lot of people businessmen of large companies would come to capitalize on this situation and build restaurants and shops and malls and other more establishments to provide for the people. Now all of this leads to us destroying our environment so that we can get more resources and find more space to cater to the demand. Of course, we all know that this would be bad for us because killing our environment is the last thing we should do. So, to stop this problem we should all go back to the start and the reason why we need these spaces anyway, and it all leads back to the rising population of us humans. There are a lot of reasons why our world is overpopulated, some reasons we can control and some we cannot.

						Did you know that the average number of children per family is 1.93 or at least two children? Now you may think that this is normal but, when you think about it, this is only an average and that cases may vary. There are reports that some mothers give birth to not only two babies at the same time but to four, five, and six babies at the same time! The most number reported is nine at the same time. Thinking about this is scary because it shows that even if you only wanted one baby you may give birth to multiple at the same time. And of course, some give birth to multiple babies in a period of a long time. An example of this is King Sobhuza II, who had 70 wives and collectively gave birth to a total of 210 children! These examples are perfect examples of somethings we can control and some we cannot. It may be because of our own genes, and it may also be because of our own greed.

						You may think now that it really is a big problem so now how do we solve this problem? One way that may be a good solution to this is castrating men and women and putting a max on the allowed children per family. Those couples that already have a child are not allowed to make any more babies. They would only be allowed to have multiple babies if they gave birth to multiple at the same time or if they adopt. This practice is already seen in China, where, the maximum number of children per family is two but, just making a law is not enough and, it should be dealt with head-on. The only problem with China is that it can be exploited and bypassed by leaving the country so, this should be applied worldwide. This solution can also be applied to criminals because we would not want the bad genes to be passed around even more. What this solution differs from the law China has is that it stops them from having any more children, which put a stop to their desire to make more.

						Now, even if this solution is then applied, we would have to wait for years before it really starts to show progress so, that means we would still have a lot of people while waiting. One way that we can solve this is by cannibalism. In parts of the world, some people do not have food and die because of the lack of food and money. You may ask how and where we will get those people to feed to others and, the answer is simple, criminals. In other countries, there exists already the death penalty where they would put those that serious crimes to death. This solution is like that but, the difference to my solution is that it is not as forgiving, and it kills three birds with one stone. Not only will it solve problems in world hunger, but it also helps lessen the space of people taking up in jail. If the government makes it that if they are sentenced a punishment of at least 30 years above, they would already receive the death penalty, it will also help in scaring criminals to stop.
				</p>				

				<p class="essay">
						If these two solutions are applied today, our future would be a better and happier place where everything and everywhere is not littered with people and, it is a world where world hunger has also decreased. Our world is full of problems and, doing this may help lessen them.
